# What is IOTA?

**IOTA** is a fee less and scaleable transaction settlement and data transfer layer for the Internet of Things (IoT). It is based on a novel distributed ledger technology called the **Tangle**, which overcomes the inefficiencies of current Blockchain designs and introduces a new way of reaching consensus in a decentralized peer-to-peer system.
